# breadboard-vending-  
so the way a breadboard vending machine is built is you have a bredboard that has routers and wires that help the machine work. make sure they are in the right spot and placed right otherwise it won't work right and potentially fail.
a latch is a type of memeory that  remembers one bit and a SR latch has two inputs S(for set) and R(for reset) and a n output called Q the single bit that's "remembered". When S is set to 1 output Q becomes 1 also. When S goes to 0 Q remains equal to 1.
a simple example is a coin-operated vending machine it has two inputs a coin slot and a vend button it's simple you put the coin into the machine and then hit the vend button on whatever you choose wether it's a drink or snack.
The vend button won't do anything unless the coin is put into the machine otherwise it won't really work well and not activate without a coin or two. They have memeory that tracks wether a coin has been inserted or not when you press the vend button the memory will check and see if it's been inserted.
