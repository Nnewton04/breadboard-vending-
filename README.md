 #breadboard-vending-  
so the way a breadboard vending machine is built is you have a bredboard that has routers and wires that help the machine work. make sure they are in the right spot and placed right otherwise it won't work right and potentially fail.
a latch is a type of memeory that  remembers one bit and a SR latch has two inputs S(for set) and R(for reset) and a n output called Q the single bit that's "remembered". When S is set to 1 output Q becomes 1 also. When S goes to 0 Q remains equal to 1.
a simple example is a coin-operated vending machine it has two inputs a coin slot and a vend button it's simple you put the coin into the machine and then hit the vend button on whatever you choose wether it's a drink or snack.
The vend button won't do anything unless the coin is put into the machine otherwise it won't really work well and not activate without a coin or two. They have memeory that tracks wether a coin has been inserted or not when you press the vend button the memory will check and see if it's been inserted.
so it has three stages 
1st one is set![IMG_1890 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdedfb26-abfd-4701-962f-b368df2b3055)
2nd one is remember ![IMG_1891 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102cf97a-40cd-42da-a530-9fccd3d472b7)
and the last one is vend/reset![IMG_1892 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a0182df-b8c5-43b4-b9bb-953830f45a48)
and that's how a vending machine works


it does that so it can remember what coin is put in and what is being vended
